# Gemini Manifest Extensions (`gemini-extension.json`)

This document covers how the coding-agent discovers and parses Gemini-style manifest extensions (`gemini-extension.json`) into the `extensions` capability.

It does **not** cover TypeScript/JavaScript extension module loading (`extensions/*.ts`, `index.ts`, `package.json omp.extensions`), which is documented in `extension-loading.md`.

## Implementation files

## What gets discovered

The Gemini provider (`id: gemini`, priority `60`) registers an `extensions` loader that scans two fixed roots:

- User: `~/.gemini/extensions`
- Project: `<cwd>/.gemini/extensions`

Path resolution is direct from `ctx.home` and `ctx.cwd` via `getUserPath()` / `getProjectPath()`.

Important scope rule: project lookup is **cwd-only**. It does not walk parent directories.

---

## Directory scan rules

For each root (`~/.gemini/extensions` and `<cwd>/.gemini/extensions`), discovery does:

1. `readDirEntries(root)`
2. keep only direct child directories (`entry.isDirectory()`)
3. for each child `<name>`, attempt to read exactly:
   - `<root>/<name>/gemini-extension.json`

There is no recursive scan beyond one directory level.

### Hidden directories

Gemini manifest discovery does **not** filter out dot-prefixed directory names. If a hidden child directory exists and contains `gemini-extension.json`, it is considered.

### Missing/unreadable files

If `gemini-extension.json` is missing or unreadable, that directory is skipped silently (no warning).

---

## Manifest shape (as implemented)

The capability type defines this manifest shape:

```ts
interface ExtensionManifest {
	name?: string;
	description?: string;
	mcpServers?: Record<string, Omit<MCPServer, "name" | "_source">>;
	tools?: unknown[];
	context?: unknown;
}
```

Discovery-time behavior is intentionally loose:

- JSON parse success is required.
- There is no runtime schema validation for field types/content beyond JSON syntax.
- The parsed object is stored as `manifest` on the capability item.

### Name normalization

`Extension.name` is set to:

1. `manifest.name` if it is not `null`/`undefined`
2. otherwise the extension directory name

No string-type enforcement is applied here.

---

## Materialization into capability items

A valid parsed manifest creates one `Extension` capability item:

```ts
{
	name: manifest.name ?? <directory-name>,
	path: <extension-directory>,
	manifest: <parsed-json>,
	level: "user" | "project",
	_source: {
		provider: "gemini",
		providerName: "Gemini CLI" // attached by capability registry
		path: <absolute-manifest-path>,
		level: "user" | "project"
	}
}
```

Notes:

- `_source.path` is normalized to an absolute path by `createSourceMeta()`.
- Registry-level capability validation for `extensions` only checks presence of `name` and `path`.
- Manifest internals (`mcpServers`, `tools`, `context`) are not validated during discovery.

---

## Error handling and warning semantics

### Warned

- Invalid JSON in a manifest file:
  - warning format: `Invalid JSON in <manifestPath>`

### Not warned (silent skip)

- `extensions` directory missing
- child directory has no `gemini-extension.json`
- unreadable manifest file
- manifest JSON is syntactically valid but semantically odd/incomplete

This means partial validity is accepted: only syntactic JSON failure emits a warning.

---

## Precedence and deduplication with other sources

`extensions` capability is aggregated across providers by the capability registry.

Current providers for this capability:

- `native` (`packages/coding-agent/src/discovery/builtin.ts`) priority `100`
- `gemini` (`packages/coding-agent/src/discovery/gemini.ts`) priority `60`

Dedup key is `ext.name` (`extensionCapability.key = ext => ext.name`).

### Cross-provider precedence

Higher-priority provider wins on duplicate extension names.

- If `native` and `gemini` both emit extension name `foo`, the native item is kept.
- Lower-priority duplicate is retained only in `result.all` with `_shadowed = true`.

### Intra-provider order effects

Because dedup is “first seen wins”, provider-local item order matters.

- Gemini loader appends **user first**, then **project**.
- Therefore, duplicate names between `~/.gemini/extensions` and `<cwd>/.gemini/extensions` keep the user entry and shadow the project entry.

By contrast, native provider builds config dir order differently (`project` then `user` in `getConfigDirs()`), so native intra-provider shadowing is the opposite direction.

---

## User vs project behavior summary

For Gemini manifests specifically:

- Both user and project roots are scanned every load.
- Project root is fixed to `<cwd>/.gemini/extensions` (no ancestor walk).
- Duplicate names inside Gemini source resolve to user-first.
- Duplicate names against higher-priority providers (notably native) lose by priority.

---

## Boundary: discovery metadata vs runtime extension loading

`gemini-extension.json` discovery currently feeds capability metadata (`Extension` items). It does **not** directly load runnable TS/JS extension modules.

Runtime module loading (`discoverAndLoadExtensions()` / `loadExtensions()`) uses `extension-modules` and explicit paths, and currently filters auto-discovered modules to provider `native` only.

Practical implication:

- Gemini manifest extensions are discoverable as capability records.
- They are not, by themselves, executed as runtime extension modules by the extension loader pipeline.

This boundary is intentional in current implementation and explains why manifest discovery and executable module loading can diverge.
